# decadance

Core Code School - Machine Learning Bootcamp Final Project

## Project

The objective of this project is to make an analysis of the audio features of songs between the 40s and the 21s decades.

## Dataset

Dataset used for this project is retrieved from the [SpotifyAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/), selecting playlist that groups tracks from each decade.

You can generate the csv used for the project by running:

```
$ python data/spotify
```

This will create the dir `csv` with a csv for each playlist and a global one called `dataset.csv`
